### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Brain Tumors are complex. There are a lot of abnormalities in the sizes and location of the brain tumor(s). This makes it really difficult for complete understanding of the nature of the tumor. Also, a professional Neurosurgeon is required for MRI analysis. Often times in developing countries the lack of skillful doctors and lack of knowledge about tumors makes it really challenging and time-consuming to generate reports from MRIâ€™. So an automated system on Cloud can solve this problem.

### ðŸ§¾ Description
One thing which needs experimentation is SVM kernels. I have used 'polynomial' kernel and other kernels like 'linear', 'rbf', 'sigmoid' can be implemented and check which is giving the best results. I have used a traditional algorithm but CNNs can be implemented for better feature extraction and classification. Also, I haven't used PCA in this problem because we are dealing with medical information and we can't lose little information as well as. Otherwise PCA in image classification tasks when SVM is implemented.
